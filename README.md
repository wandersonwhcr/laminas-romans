Zend Framework Romans Integration

## Description

This package provides a Zend Framework integration for
[Romans](https://github.com/wandersonwhcr/romans) library, providing tools to
filter a `string` with a Roman number to `int` and vice-versa, validate a
`string` that contains this type of number and, finally, hydrate the content to
`int`.
